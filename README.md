# GHA Demo 

This repository is just meant to be used to test github actions workflows. It
consists of a simple API, with some tests and benchmarks. I am doing a small
write up of workflows for Rust (and other cloud tooling) over at [Code To
Cloud](https://github.com/codetocloudorg/platform-engineering).

If you just want the files, I'll be porting them over to
[this](https://github.com/jdeinum/rust_ci) repo so you can just merge / checkout
the ones you want.
